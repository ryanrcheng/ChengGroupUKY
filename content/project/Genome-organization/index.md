We previously used a combination of machine learning and physical modeling to show that epigenetic information (i.e., chemical modifications of the histones) was sufficient to predict the structural ensembles of human interphase chromosomes (Di Pierro & Cheng et al, PNAS 2018). Our current work continues to explore the relationship between epigenetics and structure using computer simulations, particularly for cell differentiation and the disease states. The emergence of these new theoretical models of genome organization have mirrored the developments of advanced experimental methods for imaging the genome. Our group also focuses on the analysis of the statistical ensembles revealed by imaging data.
